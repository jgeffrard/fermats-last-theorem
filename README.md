# Fermat's Last Theorem with a brute force approach

My crack at solving Fermat's Last Theorem which was in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's "most difficult mathematical problem":

Rust program which attempts to prove if Fermat's Last Theorem is true for a, b, c, and n <= 100 with a brute force approach

## Description

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
According to Wikipedia, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive
integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n = 1 and n = 2 have
been known since antiquity to have an infinite number of solutions.
